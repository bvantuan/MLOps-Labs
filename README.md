# MLOps-Labs
MLOps Hands-on labs I learned during my specialization 
[Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) 
on Coursera offered by **DeepLearning.AI**. These labs are offered by [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) via **Qwiklabs**.

## Labs
1. [Classify Images of Clouds in the Cloud with AutoML Images](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/8406?locale=en&parent=catalog) \
Train a machine learning model and generate predictions on it through the [AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl).
2. [Distributed Multi-worker TensorFlow Training on Kubernetes](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/17646?parent=catalog) \
Using [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) and 
[Kubeflow TFJob](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/tftraining/) to scale out TensorFlow distributed training.
3. Identifying Bias in Mortgage Data using Cloud AI Platform and the What-if Tool
4. [Autoscaling TensorFlow Model Deployments with TF Serving and Kubernetes](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/17649?parent=catalog) 
	* Deploying **ResNet101** using [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/architecture) and Kubernetes.
	* Using Kubernetes [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) 
to automatically scale the number of TensorFlow Serving replicas based on observed CPU utilization. 
	* Using [GKE Cluster Autoscaler](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler) 
to automatically resizes the number of nodes in a given node pool 
based on the resource demands generated by the TensorFlow Serving Deployment.
	* Monitoring the model deployment using the testing tool [Locust](https://locust.io/) and 
[GKE Dashboards](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/dashboards).
5. [TFX on Google Cloud Vertex Pipelines](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/29775?parent=catalog) \
Build and deploy a [TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) pipeline to Vertex Pipelines.
6. [Implementing Canary Releases of TensorFlow Model Deployments with Kubernetes and Istio](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/18471?parent=catalog)
	* Deploying **ResNet50** (a production model) and **ResNet101** (a canary release) using TensorFlow Serving as a Kubernetes Deployment.
	* Configuring traffic splitting strategies between two models based on weighted load balancing and on request headers using [Istio](https://istio.io/).
7. [Data Loss Prevention: Qwik Start - JSON](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/600?parent=catalog) \
Inspect and redact any sensitive information of data that was found using
[Data Loss Prevention API](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/).
